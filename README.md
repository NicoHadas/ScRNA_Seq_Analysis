### About
Welcome to the Nico's scRNA-Seq GitHub, your go-to hub of ScRNA-Seq analysis for my research endeavors.

### Research 
In this repository, you will find a collection of analyses and pipelines thast I have developed. These analyses have a particular emphasis on airway and motile cilia-related datasets, addressing the transcriptomic profiles of genetic ciliopathies.
